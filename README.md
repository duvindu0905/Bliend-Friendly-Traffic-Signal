Blind-Friendly Traffic Signal

This project aims to develop a traffic light system that is accessible to visually impaired individuals.
It integrates IoT technology, signal processing, and various electronic components to enhance safety and accessibility.
Key features include tactile and audible signaling through a buzzer and vibration module, making road crossings safer and more inclusive for visually impaired pedestrians.

Features

1) Tactile and Audible Alerts: Vibrator and buzzer modules provide signals for visually impaired pedestrians.
2) IoT Integration: Utilizes NodeMCU ESP8266 boards for communication and control.
3) Real-Time Feedback: Firebase is used to update and retrieve data in real-time.
4) Energy Efficiency: Enhanced lighting for better visibility while conserving energy.

Technologies Used

1) Hardware: NodeMCU ESP8266, TCRT5000 sensors, LEDs, buzzer module, and vibrator module.
2) Software: Firebase Realtime Database, Arduino IDE for programming NodeMCU.
3) Programming Languages: C++ (Arduino), JavaScript.

Methodology

1) Design and Testing: Individual components, such as sensors and LEDs, were tested for functionality.
2) Integration: All components were connected to the NodeMCU ESP8266 boards.
3) Communication: Data is transmitted between two NodeMCU boards to control the buzzer and vibration modules based on sensor readings.
4) Final Testing: The complete system was tested under various conditions to ensure reliability and safety.
